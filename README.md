Then navigate in command line to the project folder and run "gradlew test".
The output of the unit test is in a html file at "ProjectFolder"/build/reports/tests/test/index.html

Note: This project was made made on Windows 10 and was tested on Windows 10, other operating systems have not been test. 
Therefore there may be compatibility issues with other operating systems. 
Due to this project using JavaFX for its user interface the executable jar is only compatible on Window 10.
